# DS 5220 Supervised Machine Learning

This course provides an introduction to supervised machine learning and the mathematical grounding behind this subject. Topics include fundamental superivsed learning methods and models, including regression, classification, dimensional reduction, regularization, model selection, and deep neural networks. Hands on examples and theoretical exercises will be discussed along with each topic. By the end of the course, we hope that the student has managed to achieve a pratical and principled understanding of supervised machine learning. It is expected that these understanding will facilitate the student's ability to solve supervised learning problems in the future.

This repository stores and highlights supervised machine learning assignments as a reference for learners pursuing the course to provide guidance and support.
